description: 'In the Toddler Program, children have the opportunity to create their own knowledge through daily exploration, connections, and interactions. Teachers observe children’s play closely and seek to deepen children’s investigations by fostering curiosity. Children form secure attachments to teachers and then peers as they explore their new environment and learn to share space and materials. In the Red and Orange Rooms, our youngest children build the foundation necessary to become curious, empathetic, and enthusiastic lifetime learners.'
