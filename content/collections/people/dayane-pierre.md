bio: 'I have been teaching in Reggio-inspired preschools for over 5 years now in the Cambridge/Somerville area. Since a child, teaching has been my passion. I used to turn the dining area in my house into a classroom and pretend to give my cousins lessons. I moved to the US from Haiti when I was 6 years old and went to school in Cambridge. I enjoy watching children grow and helping them reach their developmental milestones. I am a self-proclaimed foodie and enjoy trying new dishes from different cultures and restaurants around the city. I have a passion for cooking and adding my own Island flavor to any dish I create. I enjoy dancing and listening to music from all different cultures.'
