bio: 'Iâ€™m originally from New Jersey, and I recently moved to Boston full-time. I attended Simmons University for my undergraduate studies and majored in Social Work. I have always felt passionate about serving and supporting other people. I have always loved children and plan to become a school social worker one day. I enjoy walking, cooking, and shopping in my free time. I can not wait to meet all your children and have a great school year!'
