bio: |-
  I began my career as a preschool teacher in a parent cooperative, right here in
  Cambridge. After 6 years in the classroom, I founded Muckykids Art Studio, a
  process-based art studio for young children. After many wonderful years at
  Muckykids, I decided to ‘retire’ from owning a business, and I am so excited to get
  back to my preschool roots & join the CES community. In the Yellow Room, I’m
  looking forward to spending our days immersed with the kids in our hands-on
  curriculum, full of nature, art, books, and play! I live in Cambridge with my husband
  and our two children, Max and Grace. In my free time, I enjoy crafting, walking,
  taking long bike rides, and reading.
