bio: |-
  I grew up on the beautiful island of Nantucket, where I spent all of high school and many summers home from college nannying, teaching dance lessons, and substitute teaching, which
  instilled in me a passion for working with young children. After completing a BA in International Relations and living in Spain for three years, I worked as an EMT in Boston, specializing in
  NICU transport. Knowing that I ultimately wanted to return to working with children, I then became a full-time nanny, during which time I was able to be deeply involved in child growth
  and development. In my free time, I love to volunteer, spend time outside, and explore the city with friends. I am so excited to continue growing alongside the teachers, families, and children
  at CES.
