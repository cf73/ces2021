bio: 'I look forward to supporting the Blue Room for the 2024-25 school year while Liz M. is on maternity leave! Since graduating from college in 2021, I’ve worked with infants, toddlers, and lower preschool; I’m thrilled to dip my toes into the world of upper preschool next year! Nature-based learning is something I value deeply and center in my classroom teaching. In my free time I love to trail run, practice yoga, and read next to my corpulent cat, Mr. Pudding.'
