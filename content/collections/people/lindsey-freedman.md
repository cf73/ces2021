bio: |-
  I earned my BA in Anthropology from Brandeis University then my M.S. Ed. in Early Childhood General and Special Education from Bank Street College of Education in 2007. I have been teaching preschool for almost 20 years, most recently at The Little School in San Francisco, a full inclusion school that focuses on social and emotional development.

  I grew up in Brookline and Cambridge. My grandmotherâ€™s joyful guidance, genuine interest in my ideas, and contagious passion for learning continues to inspire my work with children, parents, and teachers. 

  I spend my free time with my own adventurous preschooler, Gus. We love to splash in the waves at Nantasket beach, meander through the Arnold Arboretum, and read stacks of books.
