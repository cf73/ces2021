bio: 'This is my sixth year at Cambridge Ellis but Iâ€™ve worked for over a decade as a toddler teacher. I am constantly amazed by how much your wonderful toddlers teach me through their curiosity, creativity, and growth. I come from a creative arts background and love sharing that with the class. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my husband and daughter, a current CES student.'
