bio: "I am thrilled to be Chinese teacher this year. I completed my master's degree in early childhood education in Umass Amherst. I have several years of teaching experience in preschool and kindergarten. My goal as the teacher is to make children learn with fun and have more experiences in class. I look forward to learning and growing with all of you!"
