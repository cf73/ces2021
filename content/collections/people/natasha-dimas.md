bio: 'I began volunteering at Cambridge-Ellis School when I was just sixteen years old! The field of early education immediately felt like home. Since then, I have worked with children from ages 0-6 in and out of the classroom. In 2019, I earned a BA from UMASS Boston, with a degree in Early education and a concentration in Inclusive Settings. My positive energy and creative nature allows me to provide an inspiring environment that fosters self-confidence, creativity and curiosity through play. Outside of school, I enjoys going to the beach, creating art, and hanging out with my bearded dragon Chili!'
