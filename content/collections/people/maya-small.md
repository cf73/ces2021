bio: 'I developed a passion for working with preschoolers when I worked at my own preschool in Washington, DC as a teenager. I have gained experience in a variety of contexts from summer camps to literacy tutoring through AmeriCorps. Last school year, I was a kindergarten student teacher in Philadelphia while I earned my masterâ€™s in education with a focus on urban education and social justice. I am thrilled to join the Cambridge-Ellis community, where I hope to foster a warm, creative, and equitable environment. In my free time, I love to read and write, explore cities, and watch sitcoms!'
