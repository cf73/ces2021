bio: 'I have been in early childhood education since 1984 as a teacher, director, and literacy-based creative movement specialist. Since 2009, I have been the Arts Educator at Cambridge-Ellis School. I am integrating all of my experiences to design, teach, and oversee a creative and enriching arts program for children ages two to five years. My work is well suited to my lifestyle as I enjoy visiting museums, listening to music, attending dance performances, and browsing childrenâ€™s books at stores and libraries.'
