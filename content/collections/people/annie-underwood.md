bio: 'I grew up in Holliston, Massachusetts, where I attended public schools, and also had the unique opportunity to spend part of high school studying at an all-girls academy in Toorak, Australia. I later earned my degree in Cultural Anthropology and Women & Gender Studies from Santa Clara University in California, and spent time studying Human Rights and Multiculturalism in Rabat, Morocco. Since moving back to Cambridge, I’ve discovered how much I love working with young children. I’ve had the joy of teaching in extended day, summer, and substitute roles at The Shady Hill School, and most recently spent a year as an Associate Teacher at Fayerweather Street School. When I’m not in the classroom, I enjoy painting, biking around the city, and practicing yoga and meditation with friends.'
