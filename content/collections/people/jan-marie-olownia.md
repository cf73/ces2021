bio: 'I have a Bachelor''s degree in Italian Studies, and am excited to blend my deep appreciation of foreign language with my love of children via the CES Language Program. I have a 19-year history in childcare and youth education, from private care to leadership to team environments to creating my own flagship ventures. I have taught arts, science, math, music, foreign language, movement, and even bicycle mechanics, to children as young as one to adults as old as 91. My favorite intersections are between creative mediums (art, dance, music) and the natural world (recycled materials, outdoor classrooms, plants/living things), both personally and professionally. The Reggio-Emilia approach employed at CES, especially given its roots in Italy, is a perfect match for my skills and interests.'
