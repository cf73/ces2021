bio: 'After a few years working in preschool and kindergarten Special Education classrooms, I am passionate and experienced in early childhood. With a B.S. in Counseling from Lesley University, I feel I bring a well-rounded perspective of early childhood development to the classroom, and I strive to help each and every child grow and learn in their own way. I have a background in art and love bringing it into my classroom in any way I can, encouraging students to have sensory experiences and learn along the way. I love to cook and spend time outside, and I love to experience the world the way our kids do, with curiosity and open-mindedness. I am excited to be a part of the CES team!'
