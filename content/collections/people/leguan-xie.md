bio: 'I am excited to join to CES community as the Mandarin Jade Room teacher for school-age children! Born and raised in China, I came to the United States in 2015 and soon discovered my passion for education through tutoring. Since then, I have pursued teaching with dedication and joy. I hope to share Mandarin language and culture with children in a way that feels authentic and engaging. My goal is to help children not only gain language skills but also develop an appreciation for cultural diversity. I am thrilled to be part of a community that values learning, curiosity, and connection.'
