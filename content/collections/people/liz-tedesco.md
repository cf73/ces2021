bio: 'After graduating from college with a degree in Latin American Studies/Spanish, I spent two years working as an AmeriCorps volunteer in the Addison County Child Care Services Office. Since then, I have happily taught in toddler and preschool classrooms in schools in Vermont, Colorado, and Massachusetts. I began teaching at CES in 2012, and I feel very fortunate to be working with the children and families we serve in such a diverse community. In my spare time, I love to spend time outside, read, and go on adventures both near and far.'
