bio: 'After graduating from college, I began my career in the early childhood field by spending two years working as an AmeriCorps volunteer in the Addison County Child Care Services Office in Vermont. Since then, I have happily spent the last twenty plus years teaching in toddler and preschool classrooms in Vermont, Colorado, and Massachusetts. I began teaching at CES in 2012, and I feel very fortunate to be working with the children and families we serve in our incredible community. In my spare time, I love to read, spend time outside, and go on adventures both near and far (especially to Argentina where I lived for two years).'
