bio: 'I knew from an early age that nurturing was a calling for me. After attending Clark University for Psychology, I found myself working with children right away, mostly in settings such as after-school and enrichment programs. When planning curriculum, I enjoy including mindfulness through activities that encourage making connections and observing the natural environment. A native Italian with Chinese roots, I value learning about diverse cultures and perspectives, and listening to stories that help to shape knowing. I love how bright and curious toddlers naturally are, and am excited to be working alongside them more extensively. In my free time, I enjoy the outdoors, reading, yoga, and traveling.'
