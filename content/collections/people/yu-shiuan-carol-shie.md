bio: 'I recently earned my Masterâ€™s in Early Childhood Education from Lesley University after being a licensed teacher and working in multiple schools for several years in Taiwan. I enjoy guiding children to discover their potential and become more confident individuals. It is important for me to listen to each child so they feel loved and understood. In my free time, I enjoy dancing and exploring new places and cuisines. This is my first year at CES, and I am very excited to be part of the family.'
