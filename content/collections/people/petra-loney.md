bio: 'I have been working with young children for over 30 years! I attended Bunker Hill Community College where I received my certification as an Infant, Toddler, and Preschool Teacher. Previously, I worked as a floating teacher at CES. My passion is working with young children and teaching them the social-emotional skills needed to prepare them for future learning. Growing up, I came from a large family. I am the third oldest of nine siblings. I loved caring for my younger siblings. It prepared me for motherhood, where I raised two boys, and eventually grew into my love of teaching children. My hobbies include taking long walks, dancing, and spending time with my family and friends.'
