bio: "After graduating from Dartmouth College with a degree in Studio Art and Education, I joined Teach for America. I spent two years teaching bi-lingual preschool in Delaware, where I gained a passion for bringing topics of social justice into the early childhood sphere. I am a native of upstate New York and spent several years teaching at and directing a small, nature-based, cooperative preschool there. After moving to Boston with my husband and two cats, I was lucky enough to find a forever home in CES. As the Executive Director, my role is to support teachers as they facilitate student-led learning through discovery and play, and caregivers as they embark on their child's first school experience."
