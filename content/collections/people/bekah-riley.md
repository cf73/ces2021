bio: 'After graduating from Dartmouth College with a degree in Studio Art and Education, I joined Teach for America. I spent two years teaching bi-lingual preschool in Delaware, where I gained a passion for bringing topics of social justice into the early childhood sphere. I am a native of upstate New York and spent several years teaching and directing at a small, nature-based, cooperative preschool there. After moving to Boston with my husband and two cats, I was lucky enough to find a forever home in CES. As the Assistant Director and Language Program Director, my role is to support teachers as they facilitate student-led learning through discovery and play.'
