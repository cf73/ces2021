bio: 'I have been finding joy in the field of early childhood education for over twenty-five years. For the majority of my teaching career, I have taught pre-kindergarten and kindergarten-aged children. In 2012, I had the opportunity to visit the schools of Reggio Emilia, Italy, with a study group. This experience has profoundly shaped my perspective and approach to both education and parenting. I am thrilled to join CES and the community of learners that truly honors and values children in such meaningful ways.  Outside of teaching, I enjoy traveling, spending time with family & friends, and listening to live music, especially when my son is behind the drums!'
