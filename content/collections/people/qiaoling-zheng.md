bio: 'I have been teaching at Cambridge Ellis School since 1998. Currently, I work both as a teacher in the Red Room and co-head teacher in the Mandarin Blue Room. After 26 years of teaching, I believe that the role of "teacher-friend" is the way to build a two-way, trusting relationship with my students, where they feel comfortable with me and approach me with all kinds of their needs. I have shared my Chinese culture with children across the school to foster a sense of appreciation and curiosity.'
