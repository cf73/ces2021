bio: 'I have been teaching at Cambridge-Ellis School since 1998! Currently, I work both as a teacher in the Red Room and co-head teacher in the Mandarin Blue Room. I love working with both young toddlers and older preschoolers and school-age children. Throughout my 26 years at CES, I have shared my Chinese culture, language, celebrations, and traditions with children across the school to foster a sense of appreciation and curiosity. I encourage them to develop a global mindset and an understanding of the wider world.'
