bio: 'Growing up, I was exposed to French nursery rhymes and lullabies from my father, who passed them down from my French Canadian grandparents. This exposure from such a young age contributed to my love and proficiency for the French language. After graduating from college, I moved to Toulouse, France, where I taught English in French primary schools. The following year, I worked as a teacher in a 4th grade classroom while completing the 2nd year of my masterâ€™s degree and thesis. Newly relocated back to the US, I am very excited to pass on my love for the French language to a new generation of learners as part of the Cambridge-Ellis community. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, dancing and teaching dance, studying photography, hiking, and exploring outside!'
