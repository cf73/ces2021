bio: "Originally from Lyon, France, I moved to the U.S. to start a family and raise my three children. I studied foreign languages (English, German, and Italian) in college and later became a certified EEC teacher. For the past few years, I've loved teaching French to children (18 months to 12 years) through both mother-tongue and immersion programs, celebrating each child's uniqueness and fostering creativity in a nurturing environment. Passionate about art, music, puppetry, and children's literature, I incorporate these daily in my classroom to spark imagination, build language skills, and encourage empathy. Outside of teaching, I enjoy traveling, photography, swimming, reading, and spending time with loved ones—passions that inspire my joyful and creative approach to education."
