bio: "I have lived in Paris for the last 5 years, but I grew up in the south of France. I studied history knowing that I would like to work with children and become a teacher. I then got a master's degree in education from INSPE Paris. My journey started as a Middle School teacher, however, I enjoy working with children of all ages. I have been teaching French to non-native speakers as a volunteer for a few years and really enjoy helping people discover my language. I am looking forward to creating a nurturing French classroom based on children’s interests and curiosities. An environment that celebrates self-expression and creativity. In my free time, I enjoy reading, traveling and discovering other cultures, spending time with family and friends, and being involved in social justice work."
