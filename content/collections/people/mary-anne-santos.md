bio: 'After working briefly as a graphic designer for a small book publisher, I returned to school in order to live out my dream as an educator of young children. Iâ€™m passionate about fostering relationships in the Cambridge Ellis community and creating warm, nurturing environments for children to explore and connect with each day. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling with my family, and exploring the beauty of New England.'
