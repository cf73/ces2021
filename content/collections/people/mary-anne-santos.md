bio: 'After a brief career as a graphic designer, I returned to school to live out my dream as a Reggio-inspired educator of young children. Iâ€™m passionate about fostering relationships in the CES community and creating warm, nurturing environments for the children to explore and connect with each day. I love working with preschool children as they make connections and share their perspectives. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling with my husband and daughter, as well as spending time on the beaches of New England and beyond.'
