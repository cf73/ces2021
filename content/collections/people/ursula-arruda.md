bio: 'I am a lifelong resident of Cambridge and have been teaching for over twenty years! I enjoy helping each child progress in all areas of their development– academic, social, language, and motor. I strive to create a community of learners that nurtures this growth in a positive and fun environment. Personally, I have two grown children, ages 24 and 28. I love to travel. Give me the ocean and a beach any day! I enjoy baking, music, and spending time with family and friends. I look forward to working together with you as partners in your child’s growth and development!'
