bio: 'I have spent most of my adult life working in Early Childhood Education, and I have over 20 years of experience working in the classroom. I enjoy helping children to develop a solid foundation for lifelong learning, which encompasses their social, emotional, cognitive and physical needs. I look forward to helping the children and teachers here to have new, meaningful experiences. Outside of school, I enjoy spending time with my husband, children, and grandchildren as well as cooking Jamaican dishes and watching the Patriots, Celtics, and the Red Sox.'
