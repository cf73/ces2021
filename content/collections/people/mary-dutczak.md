bio: 'I have a BA in Chinese Language and Literature from Umass Amherst. In 2014, I began my journey in early childhood education as a temporary teacher but immediately fell in love with the work. Since then, I have continued my education to gain the knowledge and skills to provide young children with a warm and rich school experience. I joined Cambridge-Ellis in 2021, first as parental leave coverage in the Day Program before finding a home in the Mandarin Language Program. Outside of school, I like to travel and explore new places.'
