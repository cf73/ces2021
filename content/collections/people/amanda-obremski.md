bio: 'I feel very privileged to be a teacher at Cambridge-Ellis since 2009 and a preschool teacher since 2007. I knew I wanted to work at Cambridge-Ellis from the moment I stepped through the door because of the warm, nurturing, and play-based environment that fosters learning and creativity for children through real-life experiences and material exploration. Since having experienced preschool myself, I knew it was the career for me, and I am ecstatic that I get to live out my dream every day with the children.'
