bio: 'I feel very fortunate to be a Green Room teacher at Cambridge-Ellis for the past 13 years. I knew I wanted to work at Cambridge-Ellis from the moment I stepped through the door because of the warm, nurturing, and play-based environment that fosters learning and creativity for children through real-life experiences and material exploration. CES has become a second home for me and I feel so honored to learn and grow alongside your children every day.'
