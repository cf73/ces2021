bio: "I've spent all of my working life in client facing services. I've been a clerk at a record store, a unit coordinator on a surgical ward, a spa owner and operator, and an admin of various stripes. I get a lot of pleasure and satisfaction from helping people, be it problem solving, gathering resources, putting people at ease, or just being a friendly ear. My interests lie in racial justice, LGBTQIA+ advocacy, science & technology, nail art, nature photography, and live music. I'm really pleased to be part of the leadership team at Cambridge-Ellis and look forward to many years of service to the community."
