bio: |-
  Working with children has always been a part of my world and my family experience. As a budding artist, I worked with my family to enrich the classrooms of the students in their care, as my parents were educators as well. I continued in this domain, basing my Master's thesis on Language Development and Usage at the preschool level before returning to work in school leadership and pedagogy for 16 years in the preschool setting. 

  In my free time, I like to spend time with family and friends, read, create art, write poetry, visit museums, play chess, and learn about other cultures. I truly believe that working with children invites you to become more aware, motivated, energetic, creative, and innovative. The exchanges with children, colleagues, families, and caregivers contribute to an atmosphere focused on giving. As I wrote in one of my poems, "there is no better business than giving."
