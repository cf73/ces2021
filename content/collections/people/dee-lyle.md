bio: 'I joined the CES community in 2010 as a Yellow Room teacher. I love Cambridge-Ellis and being part of a community that supports and encourages children as they explore and develop into problem solvers and community members. I live in Arlington with my daughter, Olivia, who is starting her junior year in college. When I am not at CES, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, hiking, biking, and being on my yoga mat. In 2022, I completed a 200 hour yoga teacher training with Breathe for Change and love to share my love of yoga with children.'
