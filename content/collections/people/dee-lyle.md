bio: 'I received my Bachelors degree in elementary education and natural sciences at Lesley University. I went on to work in the Cambridge public schools, as well as Lexington and Brooklineâ€™s extended day programs before coming to Cambridge-Ellis in 2010. I love being part of a community that supports and encourages children as they explore and develop into problem solvers and community members. I live in Arlington with my daughter, and love yoga, kayaking, biking, and being active outdoors.'
