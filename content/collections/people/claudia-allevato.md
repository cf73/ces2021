bio: 'I am proud to be a long-standing member of the Cambridge-Ellis School. Since 2000, I have supported many children from two to four years of age in the Day Program and Rainbow Rooms. As a native speaker of Portuguese, I love to share my language and Brazilian culture with all the children at Cambridge-Ellis. Outside of school, I enjoy my family, cooking, dancing, and spending time with my cat Shana.'
