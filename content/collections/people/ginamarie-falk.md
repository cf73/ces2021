bio: 'Engaging with others in French is a big, special part of my life, and working with children through the lens of French immersion is a career path that I hold near to my heart. I am energized by students and colleagues alike, and believe that together we can foster a creative, kind, and thoughtful environment. One of my biggest goals in the French classroom is to expose children to the vastness of the francophone world â€“ its people, its music, its food, and its diversity. When I am not teaching, you can find me singing in choirs and chamber ensembles all around the greater Boston area, cooking big meals for my friends and family, or having impromptu dance parties.'
