bio: 'After receiving my teaching degree from South China Normal University in early education, I taught kindergarten in China for four years. In 1997 I moved to the US and taught Chinese Mandarin to young children for over a decade. At CES I taught an additional 9 plus years as teacher/co-head teacher. My husband and I raise two daughters who are now out of college and well on their way to chasing down their dreams. I am excited to now support this community as a floating teacher. I love having the opportunity to work with your children every day and am so happy to be a part of the Cambridge-Ellis community!'
