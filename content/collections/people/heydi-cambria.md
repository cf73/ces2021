bio: 'Originally from Peru, I moved to the US in 2004, after completing my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Philosophy, Psychology and Social Science. Once in the US, I worked for Bilingual Boston, Global Child, and The Language Express as a Spanish instructor in the greater Metro-west area. For five years, I taught at Oak Meadow Montessori School where I gained a passion for student led learning. I started working at Cambridge-Ellis School in the summer of 2017, and have enjoyed every second of my experience. I have had the privilege of being both a teacher and a parent here at CES. My daughter CeCe was a student of the Yellow and Blue room, and learned Mandarin in the after school program. After homeschooling my daughter for one year, I am ready to return to teaching at CES!'
