bio: 'With three decades of teaching experience in early childhood programs, I was impressed with the quality of care and professionalism that I observed when I came to CES. I knew it was a place where I could continue to grow as an educator. I love working with the four and five year-olds as they explore and discover their world and share their thoughts and insights. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my husband and twin daughters. Together we bike, ski, hike, and revel in nature.'
