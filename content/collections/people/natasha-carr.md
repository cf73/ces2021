bio: 'I am proud to be a toddler mom and teacher! Cambridge-Ellis is where my love for childhood education sparked. I began volunteering at 16 years old and have been part of the community since! My experience has allowed me to work closely with children from ages 0-6, in and out of the classroom. In 2019, I earned a BA from UMASS Boston, with a degree in early education with a concentration in inclusive settings. Outside of school, I enjoy nature, art and spending time with loved ones!'
