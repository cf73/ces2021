bio: 'As the Development Director, I work on a number of exciting projects, from our Annual Fund that supports completing our budget, to our auction in the spring, from alumni outreach to fostering a sense of connection and community with all families. Prior to joining the Cambridge-Ellis School, I have a long history of working in environmental education, managing farm-based learning programs for toddlers through teens. If you ever want to chat with me about gardening or growing food, I’m your gal! I am a beekeeper and a fiber artist, and when I’m not working on those projects or at school, you can find me walking my two dogs around Cambridge, or playing with my 6-month old son.'
