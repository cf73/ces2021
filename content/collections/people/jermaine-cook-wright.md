bio: 'I am originally from Jamaica. As a child, I always wanted to be in the military, but after a summer of helping a friend who owned a preschool, I found my true calling. I became a preschool teacher in Jamaica in 1997, then moved to the US before the birth of my first daughter. I joined the teaching team at Cambridge-Ellis in 1999. I love being a preschool teacher, and I truly think itâ€™s the best job in the world. I have been married for over two decades, and I have 3 children who have all gone to Cambridge-Ellis.'
