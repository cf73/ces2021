bio: 'After graduating from college and working briefly as a journalist, I rediscovered my passion for working with young children while volunteering at a preschool for children who were homeless. I have taught ages 3-5 and have been teaching at CES since 2017. My favorite part about teaching is seeing the world through the children’s eyes and learning beside them. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, exploring new places, and relaxing at my family’s lake house in NH.'
