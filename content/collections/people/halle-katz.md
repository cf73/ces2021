bio: 'Working both in front of the classroom and behind the scenes, Halle considers herself a professional connection-builder. After graduating from Brown University, Halle began her career in education and youth development, first at Bentley University and then at The Steppingstone Foundation, where she worked with hundreds of middle and high school families as a student support counselor. Continuing her equity-focused work, Halle pivoted to social-emotional literacy consulting with Gateway Access to Jewish Education and immersed herself in the Greater Boston community as a dance, movement, and wellness leader for people of all ages and abilities. Most recently, Halle partnered with Open Door Arts to bring to life an integrative dance program for neurodiverse learners at The Higginson Inclusion School in Roxbury, MA. This year, Halle is thrilled to be joining Wellesley Theatre Project as a choreographer for their 2024-2025 production season. Previous teaching credits include JCC Boston, BPS Summer Early Focus, Dance for All People, Urbanity Dance, Babson College, Brown University, Temple Aliyah, Needham Community Education, and her own Movement & More. Halle holds certifications from The Embody Lab, Kripalu School of Mindful Outdoor Education, and Brain-Compatible Dance Education Teaching Institute.'
