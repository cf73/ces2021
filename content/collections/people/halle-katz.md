bio: 'Working in education as both a teacher and administrator, Halle considers herself a bridge between people and practices that shape inclusive and creative communities. Halle joined Cambridge-Ellis in August 2023, where she has since found a community that shares her passion for play and nature-based early childhood development. A graduate of Brown University, Halle began her career as a college admissions officer at Bentley University, before transitioning to school counseling and youth development at The Steppingstone Foundation; over the span of 3.5 years, Halle coached hundreds of middle and high school students across the city of Boston, as they navigated first-generation pathways to higher education. At the same time, Halle has been teaching dance professionally since 2016. Determined to expand social-emotional literacy and integrate the body into learning, she pivoted to freelance consulting and teaching and now leads movement & mindfulness programs for movers of all ages and abilities across Greater Boston. Most recently, Halle partnered with Open Door Arts to bring to life an adaptive dance program for neurodiverse learners at The Higginson Inclusion School in Roxbury. This year, Halle is thrilled to join her arts academy alma mater, Wellesley Theatre Project, as a choreographer for their 2024-2025 production season. Other teaching residency credits include: JCC Boston, The British International School of Boston, Babson College, Needham Community Education, Temple Aliyah, Dance for All People, The Center at The Heights, and more. Halle holds practitioner certifications from The Embody Lab, Kripalu School of Mindful Outdoor Education, and Brain-Compatible Dance Education Teaching Institute.'
