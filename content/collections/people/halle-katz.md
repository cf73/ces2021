bio: 'Working in education as both a teacher and administrator, Halle considers herself a bridge between people and practices that shape inclusive and creative communities. Halle joined Cambridge-Ellis in August 2023, where she has since found a community that shares her passion for play and nature-based early childhood development. A graduate of Brown University, Halle began her career as a college admissions officer and Bentley University, before pivoting to school counseling and youth development at The Steppingstone Foundation; over the span of 3.5 years, Halle supported hundreds of middle and high school students across the city of Boston, as they navigated first-generation pathways to higher education. Additionally, Halle has been teaching dance professionally since 2016. Determined to expand social-emotional literacy through mind-body learning, she pivoted to freelance consulting and teaching, leading SEL workshops around community belonging and teaching dance to movers of all abilities-- including preschool age children at JCC Boston, elementary school students at The British International School of Boston, young adults at Babson College, and older adults at Dance for All People. Most recently, Halle partnered with Open Door Arts to bring to life a dance integration program for neurodiverse learners at The Higginson Inclusion School in Roxbury. This year, Halle is thrilled to join her arts education alma mater, Wellesley Theatre Project, as a choreographer for their 2024-2025 production season. Halle holds certifications from The Embody Lab, Kripalu School of Mindful Outdoor Education, and Brain-Compatible Dance Education Teaching Institute.'
