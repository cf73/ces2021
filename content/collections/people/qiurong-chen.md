bio: |-
  I was born and raised in China and moved to the United States in 2023. My native
  languages are Mandarin and Cantonese. I love learning languages and hope to share
  this passion with my students as they learn Mandarin. After graduating in 2019, I
  worked as an elementary school teacher in China. I truly enjoy spending time with
  children and helping them discover their potential. I&#39;m excited to join the CES family
  and look forward to creating a fun and engaging learning environment for our
  students.
