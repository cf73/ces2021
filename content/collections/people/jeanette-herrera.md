bio: 'I grew up in Lima, Peru, and am fluent in Spanish and Portuguese. Since moving to the US over a decade ago, I have had the pleasure of working with infants and children of all ages as a nanny. Through these experiences, I realized I wanted to become a teacher. In 2019, I completed my Associateâ€™s Degree in Early Childhood Education. In 2022, I finished my Bachelor of Arts in Early Childhood Education and Care at Cambridge College. I love to travel with my family, and my favorite food is ceviche.'
