bio: 'With over 19 years of philanthropic management experience in the non-profit education space in Manhattan, I joined the Cambridge-Ellis School in 2016. Previously, I worked as a senior major gifts specialist and volunteer management director at Columbia University and PBS Channel Thirteen. I enjoy connecting with parents and alumni to enrich the lives of our earliest learners on behalf of the Cambridge-Ellis School. From Provincetown, Massachusetts, I currently reside in Cambridge with my husband and son.'
