bio: 'I have been teaching for over twenty years! 14 of those wonderful years have been spent here, at Cambridge-Ellis, as both a teacher and a parent. When Iâ€™m not teaching, I spend a lot of time with my friends and family. We enjoy exploring parks, visiting museums and eating yummy food together. My favorite thing to do, at all times, is making beautiful, messy art with my kids, both at home and with yours, at school!'
