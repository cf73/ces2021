bio: 'For almost twenty years I have had the privilege of teaching a very diverse group of children. In New York and in Massachusetts, Iâ€™ve worked with preschoolers and early elementary aged children in school settings, art centers, and through outreach programs. Eight of those wonderful years have been spent here, at Cambridge-Ellis, as both a teacher and a parent. My son spent three amazing years here, and we were very lucky to have had that opportunity! When I am not teaching I spend a lot of time with my family and friends. I enjoy going to the movies with my son, and I love watching his dance performances.'
