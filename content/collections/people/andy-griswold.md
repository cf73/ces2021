bio: 'I am very happy to support the school’s excellent program in early childhood education as the Business Manager. In 2002, I entered the non-profit world, working for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston as the business manager for my parish, St. Paul’s in Harvard Square. The parish includes St. Paul’s Choir School and the Harvard Catholic Center, and is very much a crossroads of the world in the context of the greater Harvard community. Since mid-2015, prior to joining CES, I have been consulting to non-profits in the area of business process analysis. My wife and I are long time residents of Medford, and we remain connected to our St. Paul’s community as active parishioners and church choir singers.'
