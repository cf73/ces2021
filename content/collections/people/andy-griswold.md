bio: 'I am very happy to support the wonderful early childhood education program  at Cambridge-Ellis as the Business Manager. After a first career in the private sector, I entered the nonprofit world in 2002 as the Business Manager for St. Paul’s Parish, St. Paul’s Choir School, and the Harvard Catholic Center. I joined CES in 2018 and look forward to more years serving our children and families.  My wife and I are long time residents of Medford and we are connected to Cambridge through CES and also through our parish of St. Paul’s where we enjoy singing in the choir.'
