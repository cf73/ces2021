bio: 'I have worked in education for over ten years, and this will be my seventh year working in early childhood. I studied anti-bias education and progressive pedagogy while earning my Master’s Degree at Hunter College in New York City. When working with toddlers I enjoy providing ample opportunity for exploring open-ended materials and the natural environment, as well as giving much time and energy to nurturing the children’s social emotional development and communication skills. Outside of school I am a mother to a three year old, a writer, and a dancer. I enjoy going on bike rides with my family, writing and illustrating children’s books, and being involved in social justice work.'
