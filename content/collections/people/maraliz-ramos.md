bio: "I am originally from Puerto Rico and have six years of experience working with children of various ages. My native language is Spanish. I hold a Bachelor's degree from Antillean Adventist University in Elementary Education (K-5) with a focus on Spanish, mathematics, science, and social studies. I moved to Massachusetts with the goal of personal and professional growth. In my free time, I enjoy painting, exercising, and being in nature."
