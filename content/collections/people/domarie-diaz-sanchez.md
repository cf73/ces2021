bio: |-
  I’m from Puerto Rico and have 18 years of experience working with preschool-age children.  My native language is Spanish. I have a bachelor’s degree in Elementary Education as well as a master’s degree in Elementary Education from the University of Ana G Mendez, Puerto Rico. Since moving to Massachusetts, I have continued working as a Spanish immersion school teacher. 

  I love supporting each child in their own path and always strive to give them the care and resources necessary for their independent growth.
