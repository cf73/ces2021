bio: 'I joined Cambridge-Ellis in 2009. I love working with wide age groups in which children can explore together, develop relationships, and learn from each other. I can’t wait to dive into our year-long child-directed inquiry this year and see where the children’s interests will take us! I also enjoy presenting at Early Childhood Education conferences, sharing our practices with other educators, particularly on curriculum development, nature education, and DEI work with young children. I live in Dedham with my husband, Tom, and children, Finn and Bonnie, both CES alums. In my free time, I love reading, knitting, hiking, and engaging in social justice work.'
