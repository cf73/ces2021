bio: 'I began my educational journey when I received my master’s degree and MA DESE license in 1998 and have been teaching children of various ages ever since. Having family roots in rural VT gave me a real appreciation for the outdoors. However, my passion for the Reggio Emelia approach and philosophy began while living in Portland ME. I enjoy the preschool age the most and have ample experience with 3–5- year-olds. I love connecting with young children through nature and engaging their learning through hands on play-based curriculum. Outside of school, I spend time living near the ocean in Revere, with my life partner John. My interests are gardening, cooking, yoga, planning vacations and backyard gatherings.'
