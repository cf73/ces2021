bio: 'I began my educational journey when I received my master’s degree and MA DESE license in 1998 and have been teaching children of various ages ever since. I enjoy the preschool age the most and have ample experience with 3–5 year-olds. I love connecting with young children through nature and engaging their learning through hands-on, play-based curriculum. Outside of school, I spend time near the ocean in Revere with my life partner John. My interests are gardening, cooking, yoga, planning vacations, and backyard gatherings.'
