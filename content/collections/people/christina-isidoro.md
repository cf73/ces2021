bio: 'During my senior year at Wheelock College, I was lucky enough to be a student teacher at Cambridge-Ellis. As soon as I walked into the building for the first time, I realized this was a very special place. I began working at CES the Summer of 2008 and never looked back! Over the years, I have developed a love for the Reggio approach, and strive to create a comforting, nurturing, and inspiring environment for the children in our class. Using the environment as an additional “teacher,” I enjoy observing children play and learn through their experiences. My family is very important to me, so when I’m not at CES I soak up every moment with my husband and four children.'
