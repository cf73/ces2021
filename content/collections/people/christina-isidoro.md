bio: 'As soon as I walked into Cambridge-Ellis for the first time, I realized this was a very special place. I began working at CES the Summer of 2008 as a toddler teacher and never looked back! I have taught in many CES classrooms over the years, and I’ve had the wonderful privilege of providing all four of my children the opportunity to grow here as well. I just had to share this experience with the wider community, and as the Associate Director of Admissions, I get to do exactly that! My family is very important to me, so when I’m not at CES I soak up every moment with my husband and four children.'
