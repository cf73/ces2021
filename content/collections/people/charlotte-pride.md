bio: "As a native of France with over two decades of international experience, I bring a passion for cultural exchange and language education to Cambridge-Ellis School. I am excited to combine my native French fluency, cultural expertise, and passion for teaching young learners to become confident global citizens. When not in the classroom, you'll find me in the kitchen (baking bread or cooking meals for friends and family), skiing with my family (husband and three children), cycling, or taking walks with our dog Zoé."
