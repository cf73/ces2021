bio: 'I began my journey teaching in Applied Behavioral Analysis working with special education students with autism. I fell in love with the teaching aspect of ABA after spending time in a classroom. I slowly moved into being a special education paraprofessional. Now, I aspire to lead a classroom after the completion of my masterâ€™s in education. I hope to be able to apply what I have learned as an ABA and a paraprofessional in any and every classroom I have the opportunity to teach. When I am not teaching, you can find me cheerleading. I am committed to two competitive all-star cheerleading teams in the North Shore that I get to travel and perform with all year.'
