bio: "I was born and raised in Mexico. My native language is Spanish. I am passionate about teaching, learning, reading, and listening to music. I earned my bachelor's degree in education in Mexico. I started teaching in 2012 in a multi-age group and got my license as a public education teacher in 2016. After two years as a teacher in public schools in Mexico, I decided to come to this country to learn English. Cambridge-Ellis School opened its doors to me as a volunteer Spanish teacher in 2022 and since then I fell in love and now I decided to start my new adventure here."
