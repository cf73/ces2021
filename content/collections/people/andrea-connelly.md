bio: "I'm from Colombia, and I moved to Massachusetts at the end of 2022. My native language is Spanish, and I'm passionate about education. I have a bachelor's degree in Physics and am currently pursuing a master's degree in the same field. I am excited to bring my curiosity, creativity, and passion for learning to the preschool classroom. I hope to help our students discover Spanish through songs, stories, science, and games. In my free time, I enjoy crocheting and spending time with my husband and dog. I'm excited to be part of the CES community and begin this new adventure with the students."
