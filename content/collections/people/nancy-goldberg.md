bio: 'I am a mostly-retired teacher and graphic designer. My interests have led me to 25+ years teaching, including a stint at CES, and a design path that has included working at WGBH, the Boston Globe and other publications. I’m so lucky to be able to continue spending time with the children and community at CES. For me, there is nothing more joyous than being part of a child’s discovery of the world.'
