bio: 'I was born and raised in Cambridge, MA and am a native Spanish speaker. I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree from Bennington College and thus began my journey into Education. I have been working in early childhood education for eight years and I am excited to dive into my fourth year at CES! My goal is to instill confidence and inspire a lifelong love of learning. I myself enjoy learning new skills and activities! In my free time I enjoy dancing, ice skating, archery, and reading.'
