bio: 'I was born and raised in Cambridge, MA. I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Latin American Studies and Dance from Bennington College. Though I am fluent in Spanish, I also speak intermediate Japanese. I have been working in childcare teaching language for five years and am excited to dive into my second year with CES! I currently live in Cambridge with my mom, dad, and two younger brothers. In my free time, I enjoy dancing, ice skating, and reading.'
