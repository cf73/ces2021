        text: 'Our Language Program offers children a language immersion experience in French, Spanish, or Mandarin, as well as English in the Rainbow Rooms. The teachers in each of the four classrooms infuse art, music, outdoor exploration, print, and materials from other cultures into the daily experience of each child. The program includes language instruction as an organic part of a relaxed, nurturing learning environment supported with developmentally-appropriate arts, crafts, music, cooking, and outdoor play.'
