description: 'In the Orange room young toddlers find a warm, inviting space to explore and connect. We closely observe the class at play to find out what themes and concepts the children are working to understand. With their interests in mind we provide open-ended materials and process art projects in order to stretch childrenâ€™s thinking and deepen children''s sense of wonder. We focus on building loving and supportive relationships with, and amongst, the children. Throughout the course of the year we embrace the many opportunities for children to practice sharing materials, space, and ideas for play, knowing these will be foundational pieces of their growing understanding of how to be part of a community.'
