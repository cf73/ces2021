description: 'In the Red Room, young toddlers (who have turned 1.9 years old by September 1st) have the opportunity to create their own knowledge through daily exploration, connections and interactions. We explore the environment through open-ended, play-based activities based on the childrenâ€™s interests and play that is observed. Children form attachments to peers and teachers as they develop social, cognitive, motor and language skills.'
