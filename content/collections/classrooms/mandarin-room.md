description: |-
  The Mandarin Room welcomes children from 2.9 to 6 years old. Through immersion in the Mandarin language, and an emergent and play-based curriculum with a focus on the arts and outdoor exploration, we are able to accommodate students at all levels of Mandarin learning, and individually challenge them based on where they are in their language development. We expose children to the different traditions of the Mandarin-speaking cultures through the exploration of food, dance, holiday celebrations, and music.

  The school-age Mandarin programming expands upon the current CES philosophy. This program will follow a project-based model where children work collaboratively in the target language on large-scale projects that interest them, bringing in cultural and local community components and connections, as well as providing opportunities for DEI learning and activism. Mini lessons will target specific language learning, and support beginning literacy skills. Children will have regular opportunities for outdoor play, art, cooking, music, and movement.
