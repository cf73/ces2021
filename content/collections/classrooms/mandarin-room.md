description: 'The French, Mandarin, and Spanish Rooms welcome children ranging from 2.9 to 6 years old. Staples of the program include immersion in each language, an emergent and play-based curriculum, and a focus on hands-on work and outdoor exploration. This allows us to accommodate students at all levels of learning and individually challenge them based on where they are in their language development. We expose children to the different traditions of each of the French, Mandarin, and Spanish-speaking cultures of the world through the exploration of food, dance, celebrations, and music.'
