description: 'The Mandarin Room welcomes children from 2.9 to 6 years old. Through immersion in the Mandarin language, and an emergent and play-based curriculum with a focus on the arts and outdoor exploration, we are able to accommodate students at all levels of Mandarin learning, and individually challenge them based on where they are in their language development. We expose children to the different traditions of the Mandarin-speaking cultures through the exploration of food, dance, holiday celebrations, and music.'
