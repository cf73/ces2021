description: 'The Blue Room is for older 3 and younger 4-year-olds. Classroom curriculum is emergent—based on the interests of the children and encompasses all learning areas including literacy, math, sensory, science, block play, art, dramatic play, and physical movement. The Blue Room focuses on whole child development and supports children’s social/emotional, cognitive, and physical development as they gain important school readiness skills though play-based, experiential learning.'
