description: 'The Upper Preschool Program utilizes an emergent, play-based curriculum influenced by Reggio Emilia and Inquiry Approach learning philosophies. Rich and authentic learning opportunities encompass areas of development such as literacy, the arts, mathematics, and science. A deliberate focus on social justice and environmentalism promotes understanding of the local and broader community. Above all, children are developing meaningful friendships by collaborating and negotiating with peers. In the Amber, Blue, and Purple Rooms, children are uplifted as individuals while learning the importance of being a community member.'
