description: 'The French Room welcomes children ranging from 2.9 to 6 years old. Through immersion in the French language, and an emergent and play-based curriculum with a focus on the arts and outdoor exploration, we are able to accommodate students at all levels of French learning, and individually challenge them based on where they are in their language development. We expose children to the different traditions of each of the French-speaking cultures of the world through the exploration of food, dance, celebrations, and music.'
