description: 'The Spanish Room welcomes children ranging from 2.9 to 6 years old. Through immersion in the Spanish language, and an emergent and play-based curriculum with a focus on the arts and outdoor exploration, we are able to accommodate students at all levels of Spanish learning, and individually challenge them based on where they are in their language development. We expose children to the different traditions of Spanish and Latin American cultures through the exploration of food, dance, celebrations, and music.'
