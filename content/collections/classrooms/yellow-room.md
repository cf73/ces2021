description: 'The Yellow Room is for Lower Preschool children. In this room, we create a close classroom community, welcoming children from the toddler classes and children new to the school. The Yellow Room has a strong focus on communication, social-emotional development, and a strong sense of self and others. Small-world play and storytelling support this learning and the integration of literacy, math, and other academic learning objectives.'
