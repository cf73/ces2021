description: 'The Lower Preschool Program focuses on nurturing and empowering the whole child. We use a blend of Reggio Emilia and Responsive Classroom curriculum to develop long studies based on the childrenâ€™s interests as they explore the world around them through play and first-hand experiences. Each child''s social, cognitive, motor, and self-help skills are challenged in a way that is developmentally appropriate and individualized. Children are encouraged to take healthy risks, foster a sense of  judgement, and explore independent decision-making. The Yellow and Green Rooms are where children foster a sense of self and confidence in their own capability and expertise.'
