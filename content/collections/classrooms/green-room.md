description: 'The Green Room is for 3-year-old children. Our emergent classroom curriculum is strongly influenced by the Reggio Emilia approach to early childhood education: Inspired by direct observation of the children at play and documented using photos and direct quotations from the children. The Green Room focuses on the development of the whole child. Through exploration, inquiry, and play, the Green Room supports the childrenâ€™s social, cognitive, and motor development as they find wonder in the world around them.'
