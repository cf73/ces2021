            text: "One of the things that makes the Cambridge-Ellis School experience so special is the myriad ways families can invest in the school. Depending on what feels right to your family, you can contribute to the CES community by volunteering on a board or school committee, working with the\_Parent Teacher Association\_on fun events throughout the year, and contributing to the\_Cambridge-Ellis\_Annual Fund\_and annual spring\_Auction\_event.\_"

            text: 'You may receive a request for additional, direct financial support on a few occasions: Youâ€™ll hear from the Development Committee during our Annual Fund drive in the fall (we are so proud that we have met our 100% participation goal for several years in a row, thanks to our incredible community!) and the Auction in the spring. The PTA leads collections for faculty and staff gifts during the holiday season and at the end of the school year.'
