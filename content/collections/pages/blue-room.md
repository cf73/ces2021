            text: 'After graduating from college with a degree in Latin American Studies/Spanish, I spent two years working as an AmeriCorps volunteer in the Addison County Child Care Services Office. Since then, I have happily taught in toddler and preschool classrooms in schools in Vermont, Colorado, and Massachusetts. I began teaching at CES in 2012, and I feel very fortunate to be working with the children and families we serve in such a diverse community. In my spare time, I love to spend time outside, read, and go on adventures both near and far.'

            text: 'I am originally from Jamaica. As a child, I always wanted to join the military, but after a summer of helping a friend who owned a preschool, I found my true calling. I became a preschool teacher in Jamaica in 1997 before moving to the US before the birth of my first daughter. I joined the teaching team at Cambridge-Ellis in 1999. I love being a preschool teacher, and I truly think itâ€™s the best job in the world. I have been married for over two decades, and I have 3 daughters who have all gone to Cambridge-Ellis.'
