            text: 'The Rainbow Rooms provide a relaxed learning environment for a group of four and seven young toddlers. The curriculum is driven by the interests of the children. Nurturing teachers foster the social, emotional, cognitive, and physical development of children through a play-based model, with a focus on the arts and outdoor exploration. The Rainbow Rooms also provide an immersion program for families seeking to have their child learn English as a second language.'
