            text: "My love for languages, foreign literature, and history led me to study English and French linguistics, and focus on learning about different learning/teaching methods and theories. I lived, worked, and studied in both Algeria and France, and my career in education has consisted of teaching both English and French at various levels. My dream and goal\_is to continue to share my knowledge and experience by teaching French in the United States, and I am very proud of being a member of the Cambridge-Ellis family. In my spare time,\_I love to read\_various types of literature and books regarding\_American history, and French and English Literature."

            text: "Growing up, I was exposed to French nursery rhymes and lullabies from my father, who passed them down from my French Canadian grandparents. This exposure from such a young age contributed to my love and proficiency for the French language. After graduating from college, I moved to Toulouse, France, where I taught English in French primary schools. The following year, I worked as a teacher in a\_4th grade classroom while completing the\_2nd year of my masterâ€™s degree and thesis. Newly relocated back to the US, I am very excited to pass on my love for the French language to a new generation of learners as part of the Cambridge-Ellis community. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, dancing and teaching dance, studying photography, hiking, and exploring outside!"
