            text: 'Throughout her career Julie has demonstrated the ability to lead across a variety of settings. She is a celebrated classroom teacher who has dedicated the last 17 years of her life to Gordon School, a leading independent nursery-8th grade school in East Providence, RI. In addition to her teaching role, Julie has been a valued faculty leader, providing strategic direction and execution to improve the school’s curriculum, teaching practices, anti-bias work and strategic planning. As a master teacher, Julie also took on the role of early childhood residency program coordinator, coaching and training resident teachers. She has been an integral part of Gordon School’s DEI work, having established and led affinity groups for teachers and students and facilitated faculty training on anti-racist education starting early in her time at the school. Julie has cultivated a strong national network across the field of early education and serves as a consultant to schools around the country on racial identity, affinity groups and anti-bias education. Prior to joining Gordon School, Julie served as a program director and teacher at Next Generation Children’s Center in Westford and Franklin, MA. She holds a bachelor’s degree from the University of Massachusetts and a masters degree from Rhode Island College.'

            text: '“I am absolutely thrilled to serve as the next director of Cambridge-Ellis School,” said Julie. “I simply could not dream of a better school whose mission aligns so beautifully with my own philosophy of caring for young children and their families. I deeply believe excellent educational settings value the whole child and the individual learner. It is our great responsibility to guide children to make meaningful, heartfelt connections to the world. When students are encouraged to approach their learning with inquiry, curiosity and openness they develop a mindset that values diverse perspectives, cultures and experiences. Our young students deserve to have their ideas and feelings reflected with purpose in a joyful, dynamic and creative environment. It was easy to fall in love with Cambridge-Ellis because this is what this educational community values and provides. As a steward of a school I believe in partnership, collaboration, and innovation. I view relationships, transparency and communication as vital elements to an institution’s growth and success. One of my first goals as someone who is new to the Cambridge-Ellis community is to build relationships with all of its wonderful people. I look forward to providing opportunities for me to listen and learn about who you are as well as begin to share a little bit more about me. I can’t wait to join you in July!”'

Throughout the day friends would ask ‘Where is Julie? Who is she talking to now?’ We are all very pleased to be welcoming Julie to the team.”"
