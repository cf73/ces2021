            text: "After working briefly as a graphic designer for a small book publisher, I returned to school in order to live out my dream as an educator of young children. Iâ€™m passionate about fostering relationships in the Cambridge Ellis community and creating warm, nurturing environments for children to explore and connect with each day. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling with my family, and exploring the beauty of New England.\_"

            text: 'With three decades of teaching experience in early childhood programs, I was impressed with the quality of care and professionalism that I observed when I came to CES. I knew it was a place where I could continue to grow as an educator. I love working with the four and five year-olds as they explore and discover their world and share their thoughts and insights. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my husband and twin daughters. Together we bike, ski, hike, and revel in nature.'
