            text: 'I am proud to be a long-standing member of the Cambridge-Ellis School. Since 2000, I have supported many children from two to four years of age in the day program. In the afternoon, I continue helping children learn and grow as a member of the English after-school team. As a native speaker of Portuguese, I love to share my language and Brazilian culture with all the children at Cambridge-Ellis. Outside of school I enjoy family, cooking, dancing, and spending time with my cat Shana.'

            text: "I began volunteering at Cambridge-Ellis School when I was just sixteen years old! The field of early education immediately felt like home. Since then, I have worked with children from ages 0-6 in and out of the classroom. In 2019, I earned a BA from UMASS Boston, with a degree in Early education and a concentration in Inclusive Settings. My positive energy and creative nature allows me to provide an inspiring environment that fosters self-confidence, creativity and curiosity through play. Outside of school, I enjoys going to the beach, creating art, and hanging out with my bearded dragon Chili!\_"
