            text: 'I have worked in education for over ten years, and this will be my seventh year working in early childhood. I studied anti-bias education and progressive pedagogy while earning my Master’s Degree at Hunter College in New York City. When working with toddlers I enjoy providing ample opportunity for exploring open-ended materials and the natural environment, as well as giving much time and energy to nurturing the children’s social emotional development and communication skills. Outside of school I am a mother to a three year old, a writer, and a dancer. I enjoy going on bike rides with my family, writing and illustrating children’s books, and being involved in social justice work.'

            text: 'I am proud to be a long-standing member of the Cambridge-Ellis School. Since 2000, I have supported many children from two to four years of age in the day program. In the afternoon, I continue helping children learn and grow as a member of the English after-school team. As a native speaker of Portuguese, I love to share my language and Brazilian culture with all the children at Cambridge-Ellis. Outside of school I enjoy family, cooking, dancing, and spending time with my cat Shana.'
