            text: 'In the Toddler Program, children have the opportunity to create their own knowledge through daily exploration, connections, and interactions. Teachers observe children’s play closely and seek to deepen children’s investigations by fostering curiosity. Children form secure attachments to teachers and then peers as they explore their new environment and learn to share space and materials. In the Red and Orange Rooms, our youngest children build the foundation necessary to become curious, empathetic, and enthusiastic lifetime learners.'

            text: "The Lower Preschool Program focuses on nurturing and empowering the whole child. We use a blend of Reggio Emilia and Responsive Classroom curriculum to develop long studies based on the children’s interests as they explore the world around them through play and first-hand experiences. Each child's social, cognitive, motor, and self-help skills are challenged in a way that is developmentally appropriate and individualized. Children are encouraged to take healthy risks, foster a sense of\_ judgement, and explore independent decision-making. The Yellow and Green Rooms are where children foster a sense of self and confidence in their own capability and expertise."

            text: 'The Upper Preschool Program utilizes an emergent, play-based curriculum influenced by Reggio Emilia and Inquiry Approach learning philosophies. Rich and authentic learning opportunities encompass areas of development such as literacy, the arts, mathematics, and science. A deliberate focus on social justice and environmentalism promotes understanding of the local and broader community. Above all, children are developing meaningful friendships by collaborating and negotiating with peers. In the Amber, Blue, and Purple Rooms, children are uplifted as individuals while learning the importance of being a community member.'
