            text: 'I feel very privileged to be a teacher at Cambridge-Ellis since 2009 and a preschool teacher since 2007. I knew I wanted to work at Cambridge-Ellis from the moment I stepped through the door because of the warm, nurturing, and play-based environment that fosters learning and creativity for children through real-life experiences and material exploration. Since having experienced preschool myself, I knew it was the career for me, and I am ecstatic that I get to live out my dream every day with the children.'

            text: 'After graduating college and working briefly as a journalist, I rediscovered my passion for working with young children while volunteering at a preschool for children who were without a home. I have taught ages 3-5, working first as a preschool teacher in NH and then as a kindergarten prep teacher in Cambridge. My favorite part about teaching is seeing the world through the children’s eyes and learning beside them. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, exploring new places, and relaxing at my family’s lake house in NH.'
