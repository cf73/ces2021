            text: 'I have spent most of my adult life working in Early Childhood Education, and I have over 20 years of experience working in the classroom. I enjoy helping children to develop a solid foundation for lifelong learning, which encompasses their social, emotional, cognitive and physical needs. I look forward to helping the children and teachers here to have new, meaningful experiences. Outside of school, I enjoy spending time with my husband, children, and grandchildren as well as cooking Jamaican dishes and watching the Patriots, Celtics, and the Red Sox.'

            text: 'I began my educational journey when I received my master’s degree and MA DESE license in 1998 and have been teaching children of various ages ever since. Having family roots in rural VT gave me a real appreciation for the outdoors. However, my passion for the Reggio Emelia approach and philosophy began while living in Portland ME. I enjoy the preschool age the most and have ample experience with 3–5- year-olds. I love connecting with young children through nature and engaging their learning through hands on play-based curriculum. Outside of school, I spend time living near the ocean in Revere, with my life partner John.  My interests are gardening, cooking, yoga, planning vacations and backyard gatherings.'

            text: 'I have a Bachelor''s degree in Italian Studies, and am excited to blend my deep appreciation of foreign language with my love of children via the CES Language Program. I have a 19-year history in childcare and youth education, from private care to leadership to team environments to creating my own flagship ventures. I have taught arts, science, math, music, foreign language, movement, and even bicycle mechanics, to children as young as one to adults as old as 91. My favorite intersections are between creative mediums (art, dance, music) and the natural world (recycled materials, outdoor classrooms, plants/living things), both personally and professionally. The Reggio-Emilia approach employed at CES, especially given its roots in Italy, is a perfect match for my skills and interests.'
