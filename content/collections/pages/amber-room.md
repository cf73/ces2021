            text: 'After working as a head preschool teacher and student teacher supervisor at Boston University, I joined Cambridge-Ellis as a head teacher in 2009. I particularly enjoy working with the young preschoolers, for whom every new experience is enthralling and expands their view of the world. I am trained in the Inquiry Approach to curriculum development and implement it each year, exploring a topic of the children’s interest in a year-long, in-depth study.'

            text: 'I received my Bachelors degree in elementary education and natural sciences at Lesley University. I went on to work in the Cambridge public schools, as well as Lexington and Brookline’s extended day programs before coming to Cambridge-Ellis in 2010. I love being part of a community that supports and encourages children as they explore and develop into problem solvers and community members. I live in Arlington with my daughter, and love yoga, kayaking, biking, and being active outdoors.'
