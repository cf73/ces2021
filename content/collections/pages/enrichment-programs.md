    program_title: 'Nature Program'
    program_description: |-
      A hidden gem in the heart of Cambridge, our playgrounds inspire endless opportunities for adventure and discovery. Whether running through leaves, shoveling snow, or planting seeds, children learn about their world through authentic experiences in nature on a daily basis. Outdoors, children can peek at chickens through a window in the fence; dig rivers and moats filled from our water pump; and climb trees with conveniently low branches. Scheduled visits from Habitat Education Center have children looking at insects under logs and following small animal tracks. Regular neighborhood walks broaden the lens from which children take in knowledge. From Dogwood trees to dog-walkers, wonder exists all around.

      “Our society is much more interested in information than wonder, in noise rather than silence…And I feel that we need a lot more wonder and a lot more silence in our lives.” – Fred Rogers
