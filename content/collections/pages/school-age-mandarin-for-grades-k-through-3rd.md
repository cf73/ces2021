            text: 'Our school-age Mandarin programming, grades K through 3, expands upon the current CES philosophy. This program will follow a project-based model where children work collaboratively in the target language on large-scale projects that interest them, bringing in cultural and local community components and connections, as well as providing opportunities for DEI learning and activism. Mini lessons will target specific language learning, and support beginning literacy skills. Children will have regular opportunities for outdoor play, art, cooking, music, and movement.'
