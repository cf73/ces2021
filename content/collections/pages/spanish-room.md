            text: 'I grew up in Lima, Peru and am fluent in Spanish and Portuguese. I completed my BA in Information Technology in Peru. After moving to the US over a decade ago, for many years I had the pleasure of working with children of all ages as a nanny. Through these experiences, I realized I wanted to become a teacher. In 2019, I completed my Associate’s Degree in Early Childhood and began working on my Bachelor’s at Cambridge College. I love to travel with my family, and my favorite food is ceviche.'
