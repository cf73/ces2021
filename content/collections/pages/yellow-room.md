            text: 'Originally from Peru, I moved to the US in 2004, after completing my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Philosophy, Psychology and Social Science. Once in the US, I worked for Bilingual Boston, Global Child, and The Language Express as a Spanish instructor in the greater Metro-west area. For five years, I taught at Oak Meadow Montessori School where I gained a passion for student led learning. I started working at Cambridge-Ellis School in the summer of 2017, and have enjoyed every second of my experience. I have had the privilege of being both a teacher and a parent here at CES. My daughter CeCe was a student of the Yellow and Blue room, and learned Mandarin in the after school program. After homeschooling my daughter for one year, I am ready to return to teaching at CES!'

            text: "I was born and raised in Miami, and I am native Spanish speaker. I have been living in Cambridge for over two decades, and currently reside\_with my husband, two alumni CES children, and my dog Archie. My inspiration and love for children began after having my own. I joined the CES staff to earn my early childhood teaching license, and I am excited to be part of the Yellow Room team. I enjoy running, skiing, biking, traveling, and spending time with family and friends."
