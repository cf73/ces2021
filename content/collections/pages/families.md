            text: 'Parent involvement is one of the hallmarks of Cambridge-Ellis. We believe that forming collaborative partnerships with parents is crucial to building trusting relationships and improves outcomes for young children. Parents and teachers work together to nurture children and optimize each child’s experience. We communicate and partner with parents through a variety of forums and believe that the home/school connection is a critical element of a child’s early education.'
