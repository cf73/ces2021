A hallmark of a CES education is our three-teacher model (which gives us a 1:3 teacher-to-student toddler room ratio, with 1:5 in the young pre-school classes and 1:6 in pre-K). This organizational commitment enhances our teachers’ ability to navigate the classroom with greater presence, thereby providing a high-quality educational and social environment for our students.\_"

Through the years, active Board and parent involvement has included fundraising initiatives that enabled our school to persevere through challenging times. Our children walk on the foundation of past philanthropic efforts every day: Donations from past families have allowed us to make substantial building updates, from replacing classroom flooring, sinks, and cabinetry to installing energy-efficient window walls. Recent successful fundraising efforts let us remodel our kitchen, add a cascade outdoor playground water table, and enhance the outdoor playground lighting.'
