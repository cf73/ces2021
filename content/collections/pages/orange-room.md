            text: "The Orange room is for 2-year-olds and is often the childrenâ€™s first experience at our school.\_Here the youngest children develop the critical skills needed for their later school life (and life in general). Through play, exploration and conversation, children gain the building blocks necessary to become enthusiastic learners."
