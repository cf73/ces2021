            text: "CES thrives due to the generosity of supporters throughout its history. Our children literally walk on the foundation of past philanthropic efforts every day: Donations from families allowed us to secure ownership of our building in 1996 and rebuild our playground in 2007. Fundraising efforts in recent years have allowed us to make substantial building updates, including replacing classroom flooring, installing energy-efficient window walls, new sinks and updated cabinetry, and remodeling the kitchen.\_"

            text: "In this 40th anniversary year, we want to focus our efforts on increasing the size of the endowment to protect the future of CES. The COVID-10 health pandemic led to significant fiscal shifts within the CES budget. To best protect the legacy of CES, raising our endowment ensures our ability to respond to these unforeseen challenges and protect our educators – including our rare and wonderful 3:1 student-to-teacher ratio – so we can continue to offer children a joyful start to their education journey for many decades to come.\_"
