            text: 'After graduating from Dartmouth College with a degree in Studio Art and Education, I joined Teach for America. I spent two years teaching bi-lingual preschool in Delaware, where I gained a passion for bringing topics of social justice into the early childhood sphere. I am a native of upstate New York and spent several years teaching and directing at a small, nature-based, cooperative preschool there. After moving to Boston with my husband and two cats, I was lucky enough to find a forever home in CES. As the Assistant Director and Language Program Director, my role is to support teachers as they facilitate student-led learning through discovery and play.'

            text: 'During my senior year at Wheelock College, I was lucky enough to be a student teacher at Cambridge-Ellis. As soon as I walked into the building for the first time, I realized this was a very special place. I began working at CES the Summer of 2008 and never looked back! Over the years, I have developed a love for the Reggio approach, and strive to create a comforting, nurturing, and inspiring environment for the children in our class. Using the environment as an additional “teacher,” I enjoy observing children play and learn through their experiences. My family is very important to me, so when I’m not at CES I soak up every moment with my husband and four children.'

In 2002, I entered the non-profit world, working for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston as the business manager for my parish, St. Paul’s in Harvard Square. The parish includes St. Paul’s Choir School and the Harvard Catholic Center, and is very much a crossroads of the world in the context of the greater Harvard community. Since mid-2015, prior to joining CES, I have been consulting to non-profits in the area of business process analysis. My wife and I are long time residents of Medford, and we remain connected to our St. Paul’s community as active parishioners and church choir singers.'

Since 2009, I have been the Arts Educator at Cambridge-Ellis School. I am integrating all of my experiences to design, teach, and oversee a creative and enriching arts program for children ages two to five years. My work is well suited to my lifestyle as I enjoy visiting museums, listening to music, attending dance performances, and browsing children’s books at stores and libraries.'

I've been a clerk at a record store, a unit coordinator on a surgical ward, a spa owner and operator, and an admin of various stripes. I get a lot of pleasure and satisfaction from helping people, be it problem solving, gathering resources, putting people\_at ease, or just being a friendly ear. My interests lie in racial justice, LGBTQIA+ advocacy, science & technology, nail art, nature photography, and live music. I'm really pleased to be part of the leadership team at Cambridge-Ellis and look forward to many years of service to the community."
