            text: 'The festive evening is a chance for friends of CES to gather, enjoy delicious food and drink, and bid on donated items in our silent and live auctions. The generosity of the local and school community (whether by helping organize the event, donating auction items, or bidding at the event) helps us meet our fundraising goals and support our robust financial aid program.'
