            text: 'The Cambridge-Ellis Schoolâ€™s annual auction has been a central fundraising event and part of the CES fabric since the earliest years of the school. The auction is a community-building event that brings current parents, teachers, staff, and alumni families together to celebrate the school and support our financial aid and educational programs.'

            text: 'The festive evening is a chance for friends of CES to gather, enjoy delicious food and drink, and bid on donated items in our silent and live auctions. The generosity of the local and school community (whether by helping organize the event, donating auction items, or bidding at the event) helps us meet our fundraising goals and support our robust financial aid program.'
