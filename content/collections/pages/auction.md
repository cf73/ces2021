            text: 'The Cambridge-Ellis Schoolâ€™s annual auction has been a central fundraising event and part of the CES fabric since the earliest years of the school. The auction is a community-building event that brings current parents, teachers, staff, and alumni families together to celebrate the school and support our financial aid and educational programs. After transforming to a virtual event for two years during the pandemic, the Auction returned to CES for the celebration of our 40th anniversary, and was held in 2024 at the Community Rowing Harry Parker Boathouse in Brighton.'
