            text: 'A: Children ages 2.9 to 6 learn language together in the classroom. The advantage of this model is that the oldest children use and model language, skills, and understanding of concepts for the younger children, who in turn benefit from watching and learning from and with their classmates as they navigate the different activities together. Teachers individualize their support and language learning activities and sometimes break into small groups to meet the language and developmental needs of the children.'

In each classroom, there are children who have never heard or spoken the language before, children who have one or more family members who speak the language with them at home, and some who have differing amounts of prior exposure.'

            text: 'A: In each classroom there is a considerable amount of whole group experience so that children of all skill levels can come together and feel a sense of community and belonging in the classroom. The teachers also separate the children into small groups to individualize the immersion experience and make sure more linguistically advanced children are challenged while less experienced children get the building blocks they need to learn the language. As children become more experienced in the language, their vocabulary grows, so teachers build on that vocabulary gradually.'

For children at the top of the age range who are learning reading and writing in school, the Language Program reinforces these skills in Spanish, French, and Mandarin. However, we don’t use worksheets or use explicit instruction in these areas. Instead, the teachers use games and interactive activities to promote an understanding of sounds, characters, letters, and words.'

            text: 'A: Young children can learn a language (including vocabulary, sentence structure, pronunciation, and cultural contexts) very quickly. In fact, they can learn more than one language at a time. There is a large body of research indicating that learning a foreign language as a young child has a positive impact on brain development, such as developing stronger problem solving skills. Think of the brain as a muscle that is being exercised when engaging with foreign language. Additionally, learning a foreign language helps children broaden their cultural understanding and develop empathy, kindness, and compassion.'
